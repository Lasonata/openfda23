# openfda

We implemented a server with a basic interface for the client to specify what information he/she requiered from any drug.

The server would obtain the data from the API of the FDA and retrieved it succesfully back to the server.

Finnally the server displayed -as a list (limit parameter could be set by the client)- all the information required by the client.
